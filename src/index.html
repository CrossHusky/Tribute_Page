          Before the formation of Kiuas, three musicians (Markku Näreneva, Teemu
          Tuominen and Ilja Jalkanen) played in a band known as Iconofear, which
          plays a genre of music known as dark heavy metal. Iconofear had formed
          after the break-up of a blackened death metal band known as Agonia.
          They released a single EP before those three musicians left the band
          to concentrate on Kiuas. Kiuas was formed in 2000 when the four
          original members (Mikko Salovaara, Markku Näreneva, Teemu Tuominen and
          Atte Tanskanen) found a lead singer, Ilja Jalkanen. <br />
          In 2002, funded only by themselves, they released their first demo
          known as The Discipline of Steel, that featured four songs, and was
          rooted deep in the mysticism and importance of steel, and its effect
          on Finnish culture. <br />In 2003, they successfully released Born
          Under the Northern Lights, and soon had many offers for record deals.
          With fans on their side, and a deal from Rage of Achilles, they signed
          the contract. <br />In 2004, Kiuas's first label-aided release was
          completed. Winter in June (MCD EP) was released in Finland and was
          well received in the metal and hard rock community. Their ability to
          combine extreme subgenres of metal with hard rock and classical guitar
          have led them to become a recognizable force. <br />
          Later that year, Rage of Achilles reported that they were going out of
          business due to the fact they could not support themselves due to
          belonging to so many record deals in such short amount of time. For
          this reason, Kiuas, and their co-workers, and associated acts; Amoral,
          Elenium, Omnium Gatherum, Manitou were cast out without a label, and
          some without any official release. A few months later, an offer came
          from the major-label Spinefarm Records.<br />
          In 2005, they completed and released their first album, The Spirit of
          Ukko, which was based on the Pagan gods, primarily Ukko, hence the
          name. In May, 2006 their second album Reformation was released. It is
          generally more structured and technical, while keeping the signature
          sound of Kiuas.<br />
          Their third studio album, The New Dark Age, was released on March 12,
          2008 in Finland with other dates to be announced. This album was a
          slight departure from their previous, as it adopted a much heavier,
          more serious sound. Their new single, "Of Sacrifice, Loss and Reward",
          was released on February 20, 2008.<br />
          Kiuas also supported Children of Bodom in their show at London's
          Astoria alongside another Finnish folk metal act, Moonsorrow. Kiuas
          also performed with Serenity Dies and Nothnegal on 5 September 2008 at
          Alimas Carnival, Malé, Maldives. The show was called "Revolution
          begins". Vocalist Ilja Jalkanen stated in an interview that guitarist
          and primary songwriter Mikko Salovaara wrote material for a follow up
          to 2008's The New Dark Age in Summer 2009. The album was released
          March 31, 2010 and is titled "Lustdriven."<br />
          On October 27, Kiuas announced the departure of singer Ilja Jalkanen.
          In Ilja’s own words: “My heart is not in heavy metal anymore, and a
          great band like Kiuas deserves a singer completely dedicated to the
          music.” <br />On January 16, 2011, at Nosturi, Helsinki, stand-in
          vocalist Asim Searah was officially inaugurated as the new frontman of
          Kiuas.<br />
          On September 11, 2012, Kiuas announced that they had fired their new
          vocalist, Asim Searah. <br />On August 29, 2013, Kiuas officially
          announced they were disbanding after a final show in Helsinki on
          October 18 of the same year.
